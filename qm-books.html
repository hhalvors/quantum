id="a-somewhat-opinionated-overview-of-books-about-the-foundations-of-quantum-mechanics">A
(somewhat opinionated) overview of books about the foundations of
quantum mechanics</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Maudlin, <em>Philosophy of Physics: Quantum Theory</em>. He
begins the book with a methodological manifesto: a good theory specifies
what there is and how it changes over time. Full stop. Therefore we have
no reason to consider “critical” approaches to quantum theory that
include meta-theoretical commitments (e.g. about different perspectives,
etc.) It does, however, offer a clear account of the important
philosophical issues. It also gives one of the best brief accounts of
Bohm and GRW.</p>
<p>This book is a bit thin on the mathematics side — which is good if
you want to avoid the math, but bad if you want to understand how it
works.</p></li>
<li><p>Redhead, <em>Incompleteness, Nonlocality, and Realism</em>. I
remember this book as not particularly pedagogical, but as quite sharp
about the various mathematical constraints faced by interpretations of
quantum mechanics. As the title states, the focus is on incompleteness
(no hidden variable theorems) and nonlocality (Bell’s theorem).</p></li>
<li><p>Hughes, <em>The Structure and Interpretation of Quantum
Mechanics</em>. This book has pretty good pedagogy about the formalism,
especially considering that it was written by a philosopher. However, it
is also idiosyncratic in its account of interpretation, placing a lot of
focus on quantum logic, and little focus on the various interpretations.
Don’t come here to learn about Bohm, GRW, or Everett.</p></li>
<li><p>Abert, <em>Quantum Mechanics and Experience</em>. This is the
classic work for presenting the case that something is disastrously
wrong with quantum mechanics. The presentation of the measurement
problem is forceful, if not particularly comprehensive (e.g. about how
the math works). Don’t come here to learn about linear operators, the
spectral theorem, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Isham, <em>Lectures On Quantum Theory: Mathematical And
Structural Foundations</em> This is a book by a mathematical physicist
who has a philosophical orientation. It’s excellent on the formalism and
on the no hidden variables theorems. But does it put forward a plausible
view about how to interpret the theory? Not likely.</p></li>
